## Announcements:

- Please verify that we have the correct courses and belts in the emails sent yesterday!
- Groups will be announced by this lecture!

## Discussion topics:
- https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/54/1061 - "What do you do when an application stops working?"
- https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/54/1062 - "There are many ways to sort a list of numbers. For example: [4,2,5,10,18,-3,14,1,6,9] can be sorted using a bubble, insertion, or selection technique among others.  But thinking beyond just how you actually PERFORM these sorting techniques, we must consider efficiency.  Which sorting technique is best and why? You only need to consider sorting an array for this exercise.  Yes, this is meant to be somewhat open-ended and draw you into more research than you're used to."
- Due Sunday night at 10:59 PM Pacific!  Don't forget!!

## Core assignments:
- Arrays To Do 1
