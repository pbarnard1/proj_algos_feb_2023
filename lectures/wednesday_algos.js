/* Parens Valid (from Strings To Do 3):
Valid sets of parentheses always open before they close, for example. 
For "Y(3(p)p(3)r)s", return true. Given "N(0(p)3", return false: not every parenthesis is closed. 
Given "N(0)t )0(k", return false, because the underlined ")" is premature: there is nothing open for it to close.

/* Reverse an array in place:
Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place.  The reversed array should have the

Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second array â€“ move values within the array that you 
are given.  Do not use built-in array functions such as splice().
